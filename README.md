# Frontend Mentor - Multi-step form solution

This is a solution to the [Multi-step form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

It is my pleasure to present to you a screenshot of my solution to the multi-step-form challenge. I have worked diligently to create a user-friendly interface that guides users through the form completion process in a clear and intuitive manner. Each step of the form is displayed in a clean and visually appealing layout, with clear instructions and feedback provided at each stage. I have also implemented features such as progress bars and error messages to further enhance the user experience. Overall, I am proud of the solution I have developed and believe that it represents a significant step forward in the world of multi-step forms. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.
